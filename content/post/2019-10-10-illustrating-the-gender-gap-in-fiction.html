<p><a href="http://www.loganberrybooks.com/">Loganberry Books</a>, an independent bookstore in Cleveland, intitiated a social experiment for in March 2019 called <em>Illustrating the Gender Gap in Fiction</em>. This experiment, in honor of Women’s History Month, was decribed as, “a live performance art project where we will shelve the works by men in our LitArts room backwards”. What a cool idea, and very eye-opening.</p>

Shelves of backward books emphasize the gender imbalance in literature.

<p>This would likely be worse if the experiment was carried out with mathematics, statistics, and computer science books. May have to replicate this in my office at some point.</p>
