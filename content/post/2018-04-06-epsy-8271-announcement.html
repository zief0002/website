<h2>EPSY 8271 | Statistics Education Research Seminar: Teaching Statistics from a Modeling Perspective (3 credits)</h2>
<p><strong>Day/Time:</strong> Fridays, 9:00 a.m.–11:30 a.m. (Fall 2018)<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> 220 Wulling Hall <br />
<strong>Instructor:</strong> Robert delMas, Ph.D.</p>
<p>This seminar will focus on research related to teaching introductory statistics through a modeling approach. Students will read and discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scholarship related to the similarities and differences between mathematical and statistical models</li>
<li>Research conducted on the development of students’ (and teachers’) understanding of probability and statistics through modeling-based instructional approaches</li>
</ul>
<p>During this process, students will learn about and critique research methods, critically examine research findings from studies, and consider implications for teaching.</p>
<p>As a capstone to the course, each student will produce a scholarly paper that explores, in more depth, a research area covered during the course.</p>
