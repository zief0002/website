<p><strong>Chelsey Legacy</strong> (first row; right) was awarded the <em>Graduate Student Teaching Award</em> for her incredible work in the EPsy 3264 classroom. <strong>Vimal Rao</strong> (second row; second from right) was awarded the <em>Graduate Student Leadership Award</em> for his work in building community. I am very proud of these students and these awards are an affirmation of their dedication and achievements in the program this year.</p>
