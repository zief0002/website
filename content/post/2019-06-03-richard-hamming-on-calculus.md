<blockquote style = "font-family: 'Special Elite'; background: #fffdf5; color: #3f3f5a;">The way mathematics is currently taught it is exceedingly dull. In the calculus book we are currently using on my campus, I found no single problem whose answer I felt the student would care about! The problems in the text have the dignity of solving a crossword puzzle &mdash; hard to be sure, but the result is of no significance in life.</blockquote>
