On Saturday August 25, 2018 at 8:08 PM I finally hit [Inbox Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UjeTMb3Yk)!

I did it by immediately copying the snippets of email I wanted into Evernote notes (my notetaking system). I also attended to to-dos more immediately, or added them to a note of "To-Dos".

I doubt I will stay at zero emails in my inbox, but I have been at fewer than 10 emails all summer. Hoping to keep things at this level as the semester gears up.
