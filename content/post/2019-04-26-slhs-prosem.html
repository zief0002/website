<p>On Friday April 26, 2019 I gave an invited talk to the <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/slhs">Department of Speech-Language-Hearing Sciences</a> in their Pro-Sem series. These are really neat as they are organized by the graduate students. This is the third one of these I have given over the years and each is a treat.</p>
<p>In this talk I spoke about the ASA’s recent call for the deprecation of “statistical significance” and all its related variants (e.g., “significantly different,” “<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05”, and “nonsignificant”, asterisks in a table). Citing articles in the recent volume of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/utas20/73/sup1">The American Statistician</a> and drawing on the historical conflagration that is NHST I laid out why scientists and statisticians have an issue with “statistical significance” and also proposed some ideas for moving forward based on those proposed by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913">Ronald L. Wasserstein, Allen L. Schirm &amp; Nicole A. Lazar</a>.</p>
<p>The slides for the talk are available <a href="https://github.com/zief0002/website/raw/master/public/files/2019-slhs-prosem.pdf">here</a>.</p>
