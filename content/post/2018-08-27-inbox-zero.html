<p>On Saturday August 25, 2018 at 8:08 PM I finally hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UjeTMb3Yk">Inbox Zero</a>!</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Inbox Zero</p>

<p>I did it by immediately copying the snippets of email I wanted into Evernote notes (my notetaking system). I also attended to to-dos more immediately, or added them to a note of “To-Dos”.</p>
<p>I doubt I will stay at zero emails in my inbox, but I have been at fewer than 10 emails all summer. Hoping to keep things at this level as the semester gears up.</p>
