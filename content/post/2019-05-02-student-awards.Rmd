On April 26, 2019, two of my Statistics Education graduate students, Chelsey Legacy and Vimal Rao, were given awards during the annual *Psychological Foundations and QME Awards and Recognition Ceremony*.

**Chelsey Legacy** (first row; right) was awarded the *Graduate Student Teaching Award* for her incredible work in the EPsy 3264 classroom. **Vimal Rao** (second row; second from right) was awarded the *Graduate Student Leadership Award* for his work in building community. I am very proud of these students and these awards are an affirmation of their dedication and achievements in the program this year.
