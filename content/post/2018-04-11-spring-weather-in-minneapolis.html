<p>It feels like this spring has been especially terrible weather-wise. We have gotten a lot of snow and it has been cold. To evaluate whether this is the case or whether I have hindsight bias, I pulled some historical weather data for the month of April from <a href="">Weather Underground</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggridges)
library(readr)
library(viridis)

# Read in data
april = read_csv(&quot;~/Documents/github/Public-Stuff/data/april-weather.csv&quot;)

# Filter dates
april = april %&gt;%
  filter(date &lt;= 11)</code></pre>
<p>I grabbed data back to 2008 (avialable at <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/Public-Stuff/master/data/april-weather.csv" class="uri">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/Public-Stuff/master/data/april-weather.csv</a>). To be fair about the comparisons I was making, I filtered the data
so that I only had the first eleven days of April for each year represented in the data. (April is a month in Minnesota that has a lot of variation from the first to last day of the month.) I then counted the number of those days each year that it snowed, as well as, the number of days over 40‚Ñâ, 50‚Ñâ, and 60‚Ñâ.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>april %&gt;%
  group_by(year) %&gt;%
  summarize(
    days_with_snow = length(grep(pattern = &quot;Snow&quot;, x = events)),
    days_over_40 = sum(temp_high &gt; 40),
    days_over_50 = sum(temp_high &gt; 50),
    days_over_60 = sum(temp_high &gt; 60)
  )</code></pre>

<p>This suggested that my snow hypothesis (we have had more snow this year) may be erroneous. But, we have had a couple large snows; maybe we had more snow on the days we actually had snow. To evaluate this, I computed the total amount of precipitation for the years it actually snowed during the first eleven days of April.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Get the case numbers for the days that &quot;Snow&quot; is in the event column
snow_days = grep(pattern = &quot;Snow&quot;, x = april$events)

# Compute the total amount of precipitation on the days with snow
april %&gt;%
  filter(row_number() %in% snow_days) %&gt;%
  group_by(year) %&gt;%
  summarize(
    total_snow = sum(precip, na.rm = TRUE)
    )</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 9 x 2

<p>While more snow than the last couple years, 2018 doesn‚Äôt stand out as a banner April for the amount of snow. We will attribute this erroneous hypothesis to snow-blindness.</p>
<p>However, my ‚ÄúApril = üå°‚Äù hypothesis seems spot on. In 2018, so far, we have only had one day where the daily high temperatur was over 40‚Ñâ. In the 10 years previous, almost all of the first eleven days of April hit over 40‚Ñâ. This is compounded by the fact that the one day it went over 40‚Ñâ, the temperature rose to a balmy 41‚Ñâ!</p>
<p>Lastly, I looked at the distribution of the average daily temperatures since 2008. This was inspired by a post I saw <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/gallery.html">here</a> and <a href="http://austinwehrwein.com/data-visualization/it-brings-me-ggjoy/">here</a>.</p>

<p>This also suggests that we are experiencing a less than tropical April in Minneapolis.</p>
