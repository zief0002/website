# Biography

I am a Senior Lecturer and researcher in the [Quantitative Methods in Education](http://www.cehd.umn.edu/EdPsych/programs/QME/) program within the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Minnesota. I currently teach undergaraduate and graduate-level courses in statistics and train and supervise graduate students in statistics education. In a previous life I taught mathematics and A.P. Statistics at [ROCORI High School](http://www.rocori.k12.mn.us/rocori-high-school) in Cold Spring, MN.

My scholarship focuses on statistics education. I have authored/co-authored several papers and book chapters related to statistics education, and have been a co-PI on many NSF-funded statistics education research projects. Additionally, I have co-authored two textbooks that serve as an introduction to modern statistical and computational methods for students in the educational and behavioral sciences. I currently serve as co-editor of the journal [Technology Innovations in Statistics Education](http://escholarship.org/uc/uclastat_cts_tise) and as a member of the Research Advisory Board for the [Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education (CAUSE)](https://www.causeweb.org/research/).
