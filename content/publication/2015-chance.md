abstract = "The idea for a new, radical introductory statistics course began over a meal. Joan Garfield had lunch with Tamara Moore&mdash;then a recent hire in the University of Minnesota's STEM Center&mdash;to learn more about Tamara's work creating and using Model Eliciting Activities (MEAs) in engineering education. This conversation planted the seeds for writing MEAs to use in a statistics course."
