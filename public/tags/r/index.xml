      <description>R Markdown is a great way to integrate R code into a document. An example of the default theme used in R Markdown HTML documents is shown below.
Pre-Packaged Themes There are several other canned themes you can use rather than the default theme. There are 12 additional themes that you can use without installing any other packages: “cerulean”, “cosmo”, “flatly”, “journal”, “lumen”, “paper”, “readable”, “sandstone”, “simplex”, “spacelab”, “united”, and “yeti”.</description>

      <description>It feels like this spring has been especially terrible weather-wise. We have gotten a lot of snow and it has been cold. To evaluate whether this is the case or whether I have hindsight bias, I pulled some historical weather data for the month of April from Weather Underground.
library(dplyr) library(forcats) library(ggplot2) library(ggridges) library(readr) library(viridis) # Read in data april = read_csv(&amp;quot;~/Documents/github/Public-Stuff/data/april-weather.csv&amp;quot;) # Filter dates april = april %&amp;gt;% filter(date &amp;lt;= 11) I grabbed data back to 2008 (avialable at https://raw.</description>

      <description>In two previous posts, post 1 and post 2, I used Monte Carlo simulation to predict the winner of the 2018 Minnesota State High School Boys Hockey tournament. Now that the tournament is over, I wanted to analyze how the model did and also think about ways to improve the predictions should I want to re-run such a simulation in the future.
Accuracy of the Predictions So, how well did the simulation do in predicting the state tournament champion?</description>

 Update the Elo ratings based on the quarterfinal games; Re-simulate the tournament  I simulated the Class A state tournament 10,000 times using the same process as described in my previous post.</description>
